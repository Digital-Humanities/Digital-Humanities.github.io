<h3>Viewshare</h3>
We decided to work with Viewshare, a data visualization tool provided by the Library of Congress and administered by their digital preservation department. Viewshare’s <a hre="http://viewshare.org/"target="blank">website</a> makes it quite clear to the user what the tool is intended for. There is a three-step process: import collections, generate views, and embed and share this information. Admittedly Viewshare is not the prettiest of options out there. If you are looking for beautiful and interactive visualizations we recommend looking into other programs. <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/resources" target="blank"> Visualizing Data </a>has a great list of resources here.  
<p>
However, Viewshare lends itself well as a working tool for understanding your data. Once a dataset is uploaded the user can create multiple visualizations using different combinations of information. Moreover, because an account (free) is required you can save all of your information and create multiple views as you work through what you want to study within your data. This feature served us well as a working process while we figured out how we wanted to approach the Knoedler Gallery stock books. </p>
<p>
We began by uploading the entire dataset into Viewshare and immediately knew we had to regroup. With nearly 25,000 records the speed of this tool was entirely too slow. While we knew that certain visualizations like scatter plots and timelines would be quite interesting to see, we also knew that there were too many discrepancies within the data to make this accurate. We needed to be more selective with what we wanted to visualize.  </p>
<p>
With minimal content knowledge about the Knoedler Gallery archives or art market data Nathaniel, Steph and Lisa admittedly felt lost about where to go next. They were creating visualizations without understanding what they meant (if anything).  So they consulted with Kelly to gain a better understanding of data and interested pieces to parse out/visualize. She created a spreadsheet of major buyers and sellers and shared it with the team. </p>
<p>
Using this information we decided to create visualizations of a survey of the major buyers whose work ended up in both the Met and the NGA.  With 40 items from the Met and 64 from the NGA this information was much easier to work with. Not only did Viewshare work exponentially faster but such specific information made date and location corrections more manageable. Moreover, we were able to critically think about how we wanted to display this information in Viewshare, what combinations of information we wanted to use in order to portray a survey of both the Met and the NGA’s collections that came from the Knoedler Gallery.</p> <p>

We created identical combinations for both museums in order to produce side-by-side comparisons.  One of the most fruitful moments for me in this project was presenting these visualizations to the team who provided different perspectives on the information. we’d be interested in collaborating with scholars who notice specific trends or anomalies within these visualizations and would like to explore the content further.   </p>
