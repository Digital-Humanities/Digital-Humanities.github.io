  Making visualizations of this data is the fun part, at least for me. You finally get to take the data that you’ve carefully collected and structured and plug it into programs to see what happens. As a relative novice with technology, I stuck to <a href="http://palladio.designhumanities.org/#/" target="blank">Palladio</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/" target="blank">Google Spreadsheets</a> to create some basic, yet still enlightening visualizations. </p>
<p>My first data experiment was with time. I decided to take a look at sales by nationality over time, specifically the decades 1890s, 1900s, and 1910s. This was a fruitful time in Knoedler history when the gallery was getting off its feet and entering the market with full force. I was curious what, if any, changes the Gallery was making in their stock over time. </p>
<p>I created simple pie charts, achieved by plugging a curated amount of data into a Google spreadsheet. I only included the information needed for this visualization, so my data set is quite simple. I made three spreadsheets, one for each decade.
</p>
<p>
Google makes this process streamlined, and it’s similar enough to Excel to have a relatively small learning curve. In fact, I used Excel first with the large set of data containing all decades. Then I filtered by date and copy/pasted the decades into separate Google spreadsheets. This made it easy to count each nationality, make a two-columned table, and from there, use Google’s “Insert Chart” tool to choose pie graph. The program is smart enough to suggest which chart would work with your data, and has options ranging from pie and bar graph to more complex histograms and scatter plots.</p>

<p>As you can see quite clearly, the largest shift between 1890 and 1910 is the movement from French to American. In the 1890s, French artists had an over 50% share of all works sold by Knoedler, but by 1910 this had decreased to barely over 30%, with American sales growing from a measly 8.9% in 1890 to almost a quarter (21.1%) in the 1910s. This confirmed the narrative generally accepted by history, that Knoedler shifted over this time period from French to American paintings. However, it's enlightening to see it in visual form.</p>
<p>My second foray into visuzalizing this data, I decided to leave the safety of Google behind and try out Palladio. This platform gives more ability to create relationship graphs, more complex images showing relationships between columns from your dataset.I decided to focus on one particular buyer, Henry Clay Frick, as he purchased almost 200 works from Knoedler during the time period available. 200 is not a large dataset, but Palladio, as a web-based application, works better with smaller sets anyway. First, I looked at sales by nationality, which didn't produce a very interesting graph. Then I decided to look at time, and who was selling the pieces Frick was buying to see if there was a correlation between where the piece was coming from, and what nationality the artist was. </p>

<p>In these two relationship graphs, a few things become clear. In the first graph, we see the same kind of disparities between nationalities as before. Frick mostly bought French, British or Dutch works, and during this time period, Knoedler sold a majority of those works. However, Frick's tastes don't seem to be lining up with the rest of Knoedler's buyers when it comes to American paintings. He only purchased a few, less than 10 of the total 173. But in some ways he was with the trend, as those American painting purchases occur across a wide swatch of time--from 1894 all the way to 1919. </p>
The second graph also both highlights and challenges the traditional narrative of Knoedler sales. Here we see sellers in a dark grey circles and artist nationalities in the lighter grey. Not surprisingly, we see dealers like Durand-Ruel, Jacques Seligmann and Geroges Petit clustered on the French side of the diagram. On the other hand, Duveen is clearly linked to an American sale, which seems to disprove thought that Duveen did not deal in American pictures. Upon further research, I discovered this sale was <a href="http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:261" target="blank">Gilbert Stuart's Portrait of George Washington</a>, now in the Frick Collection in New York. 
<p>This process of curating data and intrepreting visualizations was new for me but I discoveered quickly that there are many programs available to those with limited technological knowledge, and in fact my subject knowledge served me, well if not better, then at least the same level of good.</p>
