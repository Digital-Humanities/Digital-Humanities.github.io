<p>The Knoedler Gallery was originally established as a branch of Paris’ Goupil et Cie Gallery. However, the founder, Michel Knoedler, quickly realized the potential of the American market. He decided to capitalize on it, buying out Goupil's New York branch after ten years. The newly formed Knoedler Gallery transitioned from specializing in French Salon paintings, the crux of the art market industry, to exploring the relatively new field of Old Masters and American artists. With notable clients such as <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/Astor-family"target="_blank">the Astors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_family"target="_blank">the Vanderbilts</a>, <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/about/pierpont-morgan-collector/1"target="_blank">J.P. Morgan</a>, <a href="http://www.frick.org/collection/history/henry_clay_frick"target="_blank"> Henry Clay Frick</a> and others, <a href="http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21129976460001551"target="_blank">Knoedler stock books</a> read like a veritable who’s who of late 19th- and early 20th-century American society.</p>

<h3>Influence</h3>
<p> It’s hard to overestimate the influence the gallery had on the burgeoning art market in New York and throughout the country. While the Knoedler Gallery was not alone in changing the landscape of the art market (see also <a href="http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21124730440001551"target="_blank">Duveen</a>), it was easily the major supplier to the United States. </p>

<h3>Records</h3>
<p>The gallery’s records constitute the history of taste, the art market, collecting, patronage, artists and works of art throughout the world. After the closure of the gallery in the early 2010’s the Getty Research Institute (GRI) acquired all of the stock books. Previously, the archive was housed in the New York office, inaccessible and not widely available for study. Once acquired, the GRI began processing and readying the archive for digitization. As of March 2015, six out of the eleven series of archives are online, free and open to pursue for future scholarship and reference.</p>

<h3> Dealer Stock Book Database</h3>  
<p>In the fall of 2014, the Getty Research Institute’s Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance launched the Knoedler section of the Dealer Stock Book Database that previously included only Goupil. Hand-written entries from stock books one through six have been transcribed by Provenance Index editors and carefully enhanced with subject classifications. Artists, sellers, and buyers are standardized according to an authority database. Every day, hundreds of records are created or edited with extensive metadata. This resource allows for numerous research opportunities.</p>
