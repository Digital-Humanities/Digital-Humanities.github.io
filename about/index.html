<h3>Getty Graduate Intern Digital Humanities Project</h3>
<p>The Getty Graduate Intern Digital Humanities Group seeks to identify and develop strategies for the collection, organization, and most importantly visualization of large sets of art historical data, beginning with data from the digitized Knoedler Gallery stockbooks. Through a multi-disciplinary, cross-campus (GRI, Museum, and Publications) approach, we combine technology and traditional scholarship in the service of creating an art market data repository with visualization tools and methodologies intending to develop scholarly research and interest in the field. Additionally, we are considering this with a view towards institutional applications. </p>
