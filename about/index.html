### Knoedler Database
	
	...In the fall of 2014, the Getty Research Institute’s Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance launched the Knoedler section of the Dealer Stock Book database that previously included only Goupil (link to dealer database).  Hand-written entries from Stock Books one through six have been transcribed by Provenance Index editors, then carefully enhanced with subject classifications. Artists, sellers and buyers are being standardized according to an authority database. Every day, hundreds of records are being created or edited, all with extensive metadata. Opportunities for research are plenty.

### GGIDHP

	...Also in the fall of 2014, four Getty graduate interns from four vastly different departments met over lunch to discuss digital art history and exciting new research tools. The interns came at the subject from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint, but quickly realized they all shared the same goal: to pursue a collaborative digital humanities project using resources available at the Getty. Serendipitously, one of the interns had just begun working on the transcription of the Knoedler stock books. The team quickly realized the data being created by the PSCP was perfect for a DH project—structured, linear and easily accessible, as the GRI makes the records freely available for downloading. And thus the (whatever we’re calling ourselves) was born!
